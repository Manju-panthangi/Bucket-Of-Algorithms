Repeated Subtraction Method of Square Root
We subtract the consecutive odd numbers from the number for which we are finding the square root, till we reach 0. 
The number of times we subtract is the square root of the given number. This method works only for perfect square numbers. 
Let us find the square root of 16 using this method.

16 - 1 = 15

15 - 3 =12

12 - 5 = 7

7- 7 = 0

You can observe that we have subtracted 4 times. Thus,âˆš16 = 4
